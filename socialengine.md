  <p class="lead">The AVChat Video Chat Add-on for SocialEngine 4 handles the integration between your SocialEngine 4 community and our AVChat software:</p>

* user name integration
* profile url integration
* profile image integration
* placement of video chat within the web site (user and admin interface)
* control video chat permissions for each SocialEngine PHP 4 member levels  directly from the SE4 admin area

The AVChat Module for SE4 is one of the best most advanced integration we have done! Why? because directly in SE4's admin area you can control access to AVChat and its features based on the level of the user

  <h1 id="installation-instructions" class="page-header">Installation Instructions</h1>
<h2 id="download-avchat-and-socialengine-application">Download & extract archives</h2>
Download these 2 archives from your [private client/trial area](https://nusofthq.com/c/) to your computer:

1. `AVChat 3.0.zip` contains AVChat
2. `avchat3_socialengineall.zip` contains the SocialEngine add-on

Extract the 2 archives somewhere on your computer.

<h2 id="installing-the-media-server-app">Media Server Application</h2>
Once we've downloaded &amp; unzipped everything the next thing we need to do is to setup the media server app to which AVChat will connect to.

AVChat uses a media server to send all the audio video and text data between users. AVChat supports the 3 major media servers:

* Red5
* Adobe Media Server
* Wowza

Here's how to install the `avchat30` app on each one of them:

{% include media-server-app.md %}

<h2 id="installing-the-application-and-avchat-on-socialengine">SocialEngine 4 add-on &amp; AVChat installation</h2>
<h3>Install the add-on</h3>

1. Login as admin into your SocialEngine PHP 4 Website and go to Admin >> Manage >> Packages & Plugins
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/se/se_01.gif.png" class="img-responsive" />
2. Click on <kbd>Install New Packages</kbd> then on <kbd>Add Packages</kbd>
3. Browse to where you unzipped `avchat3_socialengineall_UNZIPFIRST.zip` and select the `module-avchat3-xxxx.tar` file from the `socialengine_4.x` folder.
4. Wait for it to be uploaded
5. Click <kbd>Continue</kbd> and follow the on-screen installation instructions until the package is installed.
6. Click <kbd>Manage Packages</kbd> (top left) and make sure the AVChat Module in the list is enabled.
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/se/se_2.png" class="img-responsive" />
7. Click <kbd>Return to Admin Panel</kbd>
9. Users will see a new link in the menu that will take them to the video chat.

<h3>Install AVChat</h3>

1. Connect with an FTP client (like [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/)) to your website and go to the root of your website (usually in public_html).
2. Copy the `videochat` folder from the `socialengine_4.x` folder from the archive, to the root of your website.
3. Now in the new `videochat` folder copy the contents of the folder named `Files to upload to your web site` from the `AVChat 3.0.zip` archive.
4. If the previous two steps are not completed an error message will appear: "The videochat folder or the AVChat files are missing from your SocialEngine installation."
5. CHMOD the `videochat/uploadedFiles` folder to `777` (otherwise the upload function might not work)
6. Create a new folder `tokens` (`videochat/tokens`) and CHMOD it to `777` (otherwise we might have token generation issues later on)
7. Now back in the SE4 admin area go to Admin -> Plugins -> Flash Video Chat to enter the video chat, you will be asked for the license key:
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/se/license_key.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
8. Enter the key (it's in your client/trial area) and press <kbd>Submit</kbd>

<h2 id="completing-the-installation">Complete installation</h2>
<h3>Connect AVChat to the media server app</h3>

1. Go to Settings >> AVChat 3 Settings
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/se/se_04.gif.png" class="img-responsive" />
and enter the RTMP connection string to your `avchat30` application on the media server. It should look like this:
`rtmp://myFMSserver.com/avchat30/_definst_`
where `myFMSserver.com` is the domain name or ip of the your media server.
2. Click <kbd>Save Changes</kbd> at the bottom

Your AVChat installation is now configured to connect to the media server.

<h1 id="avchat-socialengine-application-features" class="page-header">Add-on Features</h1>
<h2 id="accessing-the-avchat-admin-area-socialengine">Access the AVChat admin area</h2>

The AVChat admin interface allows you to kick and ban users, view private discussions, log in as hidden, close, open and delete rooms, change the license key, etc.
SocialEngine PHP 4 has 5 default member levels: Public, Default Level, Moderators, Admins and Super Admins.

By default Moderators, Admins and Super Admins have access to the AVChat admin interface.

Access to the AVChat admin interface and what admin features each member level gets can be controlled from: Manage -> Member Level AVChat 3 Permision.


<h2 id="open-avchat-in-a-popup-window-socialengine">Open AVChat in a pop up</h2>

By default AVChat 3 is embedded in your Socialengine page but you might want AVChat to open in a pop up window to make it easier for your users to browse your website while in the chat.
While logged in the admin area of SE4:

* Go to Settings -> General AVChat 3 Settings
* Set the Open AVChat 3 in radio option to in popup
* Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes


<h2 id="avchat-socialengine-ads">Placing ads around the video chat</h2>

Any ads can be placed around AVChat, including Google Ad-Sense.

You can place ads around:

* The chat area if the selected open method is Embeded.
* The Open chat button if the selected open method is Popup.

To place ads around AVChat (or around the Open Chat Button if open popup open method is selected), you need to edit this file: `application/modules/Avchat3/views/scripts/index/index.tpl`

Where you can place the ads:

1. On the top of the chat. In this case what you have to do is place the ads code before this line:
`<?php if($this->open_method == 1){ ?>`
2. In the right side of the chat. In this case you will have to use floated divs or tables to encapsulate the chat area and the ads.
3. On the bottom of the chat. In this case what you have to do is place the ads code after this line:
`<?php } ?>`
4. In the left side of the chat. In this case you will have to use floated divs or tables to encapsulate the chat area and the ads.
5. Or you can place the ads in any of the combined situations presented.


<h2 id="socialengine-member-levels">SocialEngine 4's member levels and AVChat</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">SocialEngine 4 has 5 default member levels: Public, Default Level, Moderators, Admins and Super Admins.</div>

By default:

* Moderators, Admins and Super Admins have access to the AVChat admin interface
* Default Level has access to the AVChat user interface
* Public does not have access to AVChat

The default setup can be changed from: Manage -> Member Level AVChat 3 Permission

<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/se/se_05.gif.png" class="img-responsive" />

But access to AVChat is not the only thing you can control. What makes this integration so great is that you can control in detail to what AVChat features each member level has access to without leaving the SE4 admin area.

Click the image below to see a screenshot with all the permissions that you can control individually for each member level:
