  <h1 id="installation-instructions" class="page-header">Installation Instructions</h1>
<h2 id="download-avchat-and-vbulletin-application">Download & extract archives</h2>
Download these 2 archives from your [private client/trial area](https://nusofthq.com/c/) to your computer:

1. `AVChat 3.0.zip` contains AVChat
2. `avchat3_vbulletin_38x_and_4x_product.zip` (contains the AVChat Product for vBulletin 3.8)

Extract the 2 archives somewhere on your computer.

<h2 id="installing-the-media-server-app">Media Server Application</h2>
Once we've downloaded &amp; unzipped everything the next thing we need to do is to setup the media server app to which AVChat will connect to.

AVChat uses a media server to send all the audio video and text data between users. AVChat supports the 3 major media servers:

* Red5
* Adobe Media Server
* Wowza

Here's how to install the `avchat30` app on each one of them:

{% include media-server-app.md %}

<h2 id="open-avchat-in-a-popup-window-vbulletin">Open AVChat in a pop up</h2>

This guide will show you how to create a link in the vBuletin 3.8 menu that will open up AVChat in a pop up window.

This is the recommended way to open AVChat as it's easier for your web site users to visit the web site, user profiles, threads on the forum, without leaving the video chat.

1. From the admin area Go to **Styles & Templates > Style Manager** and choose **Edit Templates** from the dropdown and hit <kbd>Go</kbd> button
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/edit_template_screen1.gif" class="img-responsive" />
2. Scroll the list until you get to **Navigation / Breadcrumb Templates** and select it. Next click <kbd>Expand Collapse</kbd> button.
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/edit_template_screen2.gif" class="img-responsive" />
3. Scroll the list until you get to **Navigation / Breadcrumb Templates > navbar** and select it. Next click <kbd>Edit</kbd> button
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/edit_template_screen3.gif" class="img-responsive" />
4. Add this HTML code to main navigation (placed the link after Calendar) and hit <kbd>Save</kbd>:

```html
<td class="vbmenu_control"><a href="#" onclick="window.open('videochat/index.php','FlashVideoChat','height=580','width=970');">Flash Video Chat</a></td>
```

<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/edit_template_screen4.gif" class="img-responsive" />

In your forum you should see this link:

<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/edit_template_screen5.gif" class="img-responsive" />


<h2 id="embed-avchat-vbulletin">Embed AVChat</h2>

Altough we recommend opening AVChat in a pop-up, the following tutorial will show you how to open it embedded in a HTML page on your web site.

1. Open the `videochat_embedded_3.8.x`
2. Upload `videochat.php `to the root folder of your forum.
3. Login as admin, go to **Styles & Templates > Style Manager**, choose **Add New Template** from the dropdown and hit <kbd>Go</kbd> button
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/vbulletin_add_new_template.png" class="img-responsive" />
4. Open `template.txt` from the `videochat_embedded_3.8.x`, copy its content and paste it into the **Template field**. **Make sure that the template's name is FlashVideoChat**. Click on the <kbd>Save</kbd> button.
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/vbulletin_add_new_template_content.png" class="img-responsive" />
5. Now you need to add a link to the vBulletin menu that will take users to the new web page with the video chat embedded on it. To do this follow the [Open AVChat](http://docs.avchat.net/vbulletin-3.8#open-avchat-in-a-popup-window-vbulletin) in a pop up Step 4 use the following HTML code:

```html
<td class="vbmenu_control"><a href="videochat.php">Flash Video Chat</a></td>
```

<h2 id="accessing-avchat-vbulletin">Accessing the AVChat admin interface in vBulletin</h2>

The admin interface will be automaticaly given to the designated users, based on the first lines from `integration.php` file from `[your website root]/videochat/integration.php` and also the first lines from the `index.php` file from the same directory.


<h2 id="usergroups-vbulletin">vBulletin's usergroups and limiting features for specific usergroups</h2>

1. Login as admin into your forum Control Panel and go to **Usergroups > Usergroup manager**
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/usergroup_manager.gif" class="img-responsive" />
2. Select from the Usergroups list the usergroup you want to edit and click <kbd>Go</kbd>. Here we chose **Administrators**
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/edit_usergroup_screen1.gif" class="img-responsive" />
3. Change permissions (for admins and moderators you have one more set of permissions: **AVChat Admin Permissions** that are not available for regular users)
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/edit_usergroup_screen2.gif" class="img-responsive" />


<h2 id="allowing-visitors-vbulletin">Allowing visitors to join the video chat</h2>

If you want visitors to access the chat, then you need to specify so from the vBulletin admin area, like we specified on the above question.

1. Login as admin into your forum Control Panel and go to **Usergroups > Usergroup manager**.
<img src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/images/vbulletin/usergroup_manager.gif" class="img-responsive" />
