Starting with Wowza Streaming Engine 4, a new GUI has been added that allows you to control the server and individual applications. This can be accessed using a browserby going to http://WOWZA_SERVER_ADDRESS:8088/enginemanager/.

Wowza Streaming Engine 4 comes with the default stream prefix **mp4**. This needs to be changed to **flv**. Here's how:

1. Go to http://WOWZA_SERVER_ADDRESS:8088/enginemanager/
2. From the top menu click the [Server] page
3. In Server Setup click Edit
4. Change Default Stream Prefix from mp4 to flv
5. Save
