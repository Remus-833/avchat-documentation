* client side files, that go on your web server (html, js, xml, swf files, etc.) and are loaded by your web site users in their browsers
* media server files that go on your media server (Red5,FMIS,Wowza) these handle all the logic of sending messages between users, banning IPs, accepting connections, etc...
