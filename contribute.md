<h2>Create a GitHub account</h2>

First thing you will need to do is create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account in case you don't have one.

Follow the steps and complete the sign up form as on any other site.

<h2>Forking the documentation</h2>

In the bottom of any page from the documentation, you will see the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button.

Click on it and you will be taken into your GitHub account or asked to sign up first if you are not already.
