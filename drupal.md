  <h1 id="installation-instructions" class="page-header">Installation Instructions</h1>
<h2 id="installing-the-module">Download & extract archives</h2>
Download these 2 archives from your [private client/trial area](https://nusofthq.com/c/) to your computer:

1. `AVChat 3.0.zip` contains AVChat
2. `avchat3_drupal_modules.zip` contains the Drupal modules

Extract the 2 archives somewhere on your computer.

<h2 id="installing-the-module">Media Server Application</h2>
Once we've downloaded everything the 1st thing we need to do is to setup the media server app to which AVChat will connect to.

AVChat uses a media server to send all the audio video and text data between users. AVChat supports the 3 major media servers:

* Red5
* Adobe Media Server
* Wowza

Here's how to install the `avchat30` app on each one of them:

{% include media-server-app.md %}

<h2 id="installing-the-module">Module & AVChat installation</h2>
Connect using an FTP client to your website and:

1. upload the `avchat3` folder from `avchat3_drupal_modules.zip/drupal6.x_component` to `/sites/all/modules/`
2. upload the contents of the `Files to upload to your web site` folder from  the AVChat archive to `/sites/all/modules/avchat3/`

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="callout-tables-responsive-overflow"> <h4>Folder permissions</h4> <p markdown="1">If your website's hosted on a Linux server CHMOD the `uploadedFiles` and `tokens` folders to 777.</p> </div>

Edit `avc_settings.xml` and change the value of the `connectionstring` node to the connection string for your new avchat30 app on the media server:

<pre>
&lt;connectionstring&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;rtmp://media-server-ip/avchat30/_definst_&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/connectionstring&gt;
</pre>
<h2 id="installing-the-module">Complete installation</h2>
Now open your Drupal's admin area in a web browser, go to `Administer > Site Building > Modules > List` and enable the `AVChat 3.x Module` .

Two new menu items will show up in your Drupal menu:

* AVChat Video Chat (User)
* AVChat Video Chat (Admin)

Click on either of them, you will be taken to a new web page where AVChat will load in the browser and will ask for a username. Type one and click `[Connect]`. AVChat will now connect to the media server and ask you for the license key.

Enter the key (It's in your [private client/trial area](https://nusofthq.com/c/)) and press `[Submit]`.

<h1 id="installation-instructions" class="page-header">Module Features</h1>
<h2 id="accessing-the-avchat-admin-area">Access the AVChat admin area</h2>
The AVChat admin interface allows you to kick and ban users, view private discussions, log in as hidden, close, open and delete rooms, change the license key, etc. .

By default, Drupal 5 and 6 come with two user roles:

 * Anonymous user: this role is used for users that don't have a user account or that are not authenticated.
 * Authenticated user: this role is automatically granted to all logged in users.

In Drupal 5 and 6 there is a <em>super administrator</em> account who has access to the AVChat admin interface by default.

To give other people access to the AVChat admin interface do the following:

1. Go to `Administer -> User Management -> Permissions`
2. Under the `avchat3 module` select which user roles you want to "access avchat3 admin interface" .

Unce a user has access to the admin area of AVChat (super administrators or members with a user role that grants them access) he just has to log in and click on the `AVChat Video Chat (Admin)` menu item.

<h2 id="open-avchat-in-a-popup-window">Open AVChat in a pop up</h2>

You might want AVChat to open in a pop up window to make ti easier for your users to browse your website while in the chat.

**Drupal 5:**

Feature not available.

**Drupal 6:**

1. Go to `Administer -> Site configuration -> AVChat 3.0 Drupal 6.x Module Settings`
2. Set `Chat will open` to `in popup` and save

<h2 id="permissions">Limiting features to certain user roles</h2>
By default Drupal 5 and 6 come with two user roles:

* **anonymous users** or visitors
* **authenticated users** or logged in users

and a **super administrator** account which does not belong to any user role.

On top of that you can add your own custom user roles from `Administer -> User Management -> Roles`.
<h3>Limiting AVChat features</h3>

To control what AVChat features (creating rooms, sending PM's, viewing webcams, etc.) are available to each user role go to the Permissions page `Administer -> User Management ->Permissions -> avchat3 module` .

All user roles will be shown horizontally while all the AVChat features you can turn on and off will be shown vertically.

<h2 id="location-of-avchat-files">Allowing visitors to enter AVChat</h2>
1. Go to `Administer -> User management -> Permissions -> avchat3 module`
2. Scroll down to the `access avchat3 user interface` column
3. Check the `anonymous user` and save

<h2 id="location-of-avchat-files">Location of AVChat files</h2>
All the AVChat  files including:

* all the module files
* index.swf and admin.swf
* language files
* audio/video quality profile files
* avc_settings.xml


are located in `sites/all/modules/avchat3`.
